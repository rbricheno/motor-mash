# The amazing Motor Mash Motor Mount!

This lets you mount N20 gearmotors (a.k.a. "micro metal gearmotors") on some things like "smart car" robot kits that are designed to take TT gearmotors (the cheap ones with yellow plastic gearboxes).

You'll need 4 M2 12mm screws and 4 M2 nuts per mount to clamp the motor in place.

It's designed so you can run the wires through the middle of the mount to keep them out of the way.

The centre of the axle is the same as on a TT motor. I'm hopping that will let me put optical encoders on the back, but I haven't tried that yet.

You'll need to mirror the STL and then print that and the original to get a pair of brackets, one for each side, as they aren't symetrical.

I didn't model the "nub" on the side of the TT geatbox (yet) as my kit doesn't require that, and so for me it would only get in the way.
